What is Cybernetics Core? Cybernetics Core is a project created for the Rensselaer Center for Open Source ([RCOS](https://rcos.io/)) with the end goal of creating a competative StarCraft 2 AI. This is possible thanks to Blizzard's release of their [StarCraft 2 Client API](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-api). The name also comes from StarCraft 2 and is a Protoss Building. For another example of a project like this check out [Command Center](https://github.com/davechurchill/commandcenter).

## What is on this reposiory
* Currently this repository is mostly empty (as the project is brand new) but this will be updated with every new development

## What is the development timeline?
This project was started in January of 2019, and from January to May here is a list of things that will (hopefully be uploaded)
* Simple games and objectives to demonstrate simple AI's and machine learning algorithms created from scratch in python
* Further documentation on the SC2 API and how to set it up and how to build our AI with it
* Further demonstrations of simple SC2 API uses
* A simple pre-programmed strategy bot will be made (e.g. worker rush bot)

## Future goals
The project is a never ending project. Because AI's are always getting better and changing over time, this project can constantly be changed and improved upon. In the more 'short term' future (i.e. in the months following May), hopefully more of the concpets of AI and machine learning will be incorporated.
